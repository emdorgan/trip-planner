# Traveleeze

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This app is a travel planner that allows authenticated users to plan their trips. Each trip is made up of multiple 'locations' and has a name, start date and end date. These locations all have their own start and end dates, along with transit details, mode of transport, and details about the activities. Each Trip also comes with a packing list that the user can add/delete to along with a journal that the user can add/delete to. Finally, the user can upload images and have them displayed in an album (NOTE: Even though this worked perfectly fine on local machines, it sadly does not work on Heroku where we have the app deployed). Please contact the devs if you happen to know a (preferably free) solution.
